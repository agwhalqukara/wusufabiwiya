He received a Golden Globe nomination for his role in the 1980 TV series Flo, and appeared in numerous other well-loved TV shows including Hawaii Five-0&nbsp;and Little House on the Prairie.</p><p>When Geoffrey’s daughter Juliette was just 14 years old she “divorced” her parents (or became legally emancipated from them).

I don’t follow anything blindly. That’s religion, cops, doctors, schools, you name it.”</p><p>After his passing, Lewis also shared a sweet message about her father via Instagram on April 8. “My dad. My dad my dad my dad my dad. My love my dad. My dad. My hero. My dad. My dad my love my loving father,” she captioned <a href=#>a throwback photo</a> of the two. “My strength my might. My friend.
