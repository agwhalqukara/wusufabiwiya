He has done his part. But I also know it’s time for him to dream again,” Brown said in a heartwarming YouTube video.</p><p>On the Wendy Williams Show, Wendy had a less positive take on the situation, and likened Brown’s life with her ex-husband&nbsp;Kevin Hunter.</p><p>She&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told the audience</a>, “I was married to one of those, ‘I make the money!’ and so on and so forth. ‘Go live your dreams! Open a business! Go, go, go!’ See how that turned out…I predict that this marriage is going to be on real rocky ground in a moment. ‘Live your dream’… They may invest in stuff and lose the money.</p><p>“They invest in something else then the money gets swindled or stolen. Then they invest again and he comes home and throws his bag down. She’s like ‘What? What?’ And he’s like, ‘I can’t do this and this is your fault. You’re over here making your money and stuff and had me quit my job.’”</p><p>Brown took to Instagram to gracefully clap back to Wendy’s comments in an IGTV video.</p><p>Brown shared in the video, “Wendy, the pain you must be in to feel this way, honey, I’m so sorry. But listen, let me tell you this. Twenty-three years I’ve been with my husband, broke for a very long time together. Struggled for a very long time together. Succeeded for the last couple of years together.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000663176878.jpg><p>She said faith plays an integral part in her relationship and that is the foundation that makes them strong.</p><p>“I did every year with him in the LAPD and he did every year with me with rejection and no’s in this entertainment industry,” she shared.</p><p>“However, God has blessed me…I’ve been praying on this for a very long time and it has now come to pass. That is the power of God. It’s also the power of allowing God to be first in your marriage. That’s how it remains successful, we keep Him first. He is first in our marriage. Not money, not business, not success, but God. He’s first.”</p><h2>Is Wendy Williams married?</h2><p><a href=#>Williams was married to Kevin Hunter</a>&nbsp;from 1999- 2020 when it was revealed that he had an affair.</p><p>It came to light in 2019 Kevin reportedly fathered a child with his longtime mistress, Sharina Hudson, and Williams “<a href=#>plotted to divorce</a>” him after his longtime mistress&nbsp;<a href=#>gave birth.</a></p><p>She said in 2019: “I never thought that I would be in this position.
