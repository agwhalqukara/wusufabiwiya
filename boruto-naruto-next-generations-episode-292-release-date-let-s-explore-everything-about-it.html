Unfortunately, this will be the second-to-last episode of the first part of the series. This month, it was announced that the first part of the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime will end on March 26, 2023, with Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 293.</p><p>Boruto: Naruto Next Generations has been on TV for six years, but it will finally stop airing as the manga series moves forward with the canon story. Even though the anime has been going on for six years, it has barely touched on the main plot. When fans wanted to see the anime canon episode continue, the studio decided to stop making new episodes for good.</p><p>We will definitely let our readers know about any new information about Boruto: Naruto Next Generations part 2, but for now, let’s talk in detail about the next-to-last episode of the series. As Naruto and the others get closer to where Kawaki, Boruto, and Code are fighting, Momoshiki has already taken control of Boruto and is planning his next move. What does that move mean?</p><h2>About Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 292</h2><p>Mikio Ikemoto writes and draws Boruto: Naruto Next Generations and Masashi Kishimoto is in charge of it. In June 2016, it started appearing in Shueisha’s Weekly Shonen Jump.</p><p>Boruto: Naruto Next Generations is a series that shows what Boruto, Naruto’s son, gets up to at school and after he graduates.</p><p>The series shows how Boruto grows as a person and how the evil that threatens him and his loved ones changes him.</p><h2>Release Date of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 292</h2><p>Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 292, “Hunger,” is set to air on Sunday, <strong>March 19, 2023,</strong> at 17:30 hrs Japanese Standard Time. Here are the different times for when the next episode will air;</p><ul><li>Pacific Standard Time (PST): 1 am, Sunday, March 19</li><li>Central Standard Time (CST): 3 am, Sunday, March 19</li><li>Eastern Standard Time (EST): 4 am, Sunday, March 19</li><li>British Standard Time (GMT): 9 am, Sunday, March 19</li><li>Central European Standard Time (CEST): 10 am, Sunday, March 19</li><li>Indian Standard Time (IST): 2.30 pm, Sunday, March 19</li><li>Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST): 7 pm, Sunday, March 19</li></ul><h2>Recap of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 292</h2><p>At the beginning of Boruto episode 291, Code met Boruto for the first time. Code also said that he respected Boruto because he worships Otsutsukis. But he also said that he was sorry that he had to feed Boruto to Ten-Tails so that the Sacred Tree could grow. Boruto fought against Code, who had the White Karma, even though Kawakaskedi&nbsp; him to leave.</p><p>As Boruto and Code fought, Code said that Boruto didn’t know how to use Karma right and that he only used it to get stronger and faster. He said that Otsutsuki’s battle experience is the true essence of Karma, which, if used correctly, can make anyone an expert warrior.</p><p>Code then tried to anger Boruto by stomping on him to show the true power of Momoshiki. But Boruto was able to avoid getting hit and use Momoshiki’s power because Code made him angry. As he used Momoshiki’s powers, he gave off a blue aura.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Add-a-heading-2023-03-15T231840.461.jpg decoding=async alt="Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 292" width=640 height=360 data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Kawaki and Code thought that Momoshiki had taken over Boruto’s mind again, but to their surprise, Boruto was still in charge. Eida then told Code that it was possible that Amado’s medicine kept Boruto from letting Momoshiki take over his mind.</p><p>The Sensory Team and Naruto stopped looking for Kawaki and started looking for Boruto. Shikamaru told Naruto that they would go together since Code would be there as well. Naruto didn’t want Hinata to follow him because he was afraid that if they both died, Himawari would be left alone. Naruto also went into Sage Mode and followed the chakra of Boruto and Code.</p><p>Also Check Out:</p><p>Code, on the other hand, decided to leave and take Kawaki back to Eida. Kawaki fought him, though, and the fight started up again. In a different scene, Sai told Amado what was going on, which shocked Amado. He seemed to murmur that he hoped Kawaki wouldn’t mess things up for him and Amado.</p><p>Boruto couldn’t land a hit on the battlefield. He eventually passed out from being too tired and had a seizure. Code was about to attack Boruto at this point, but time seemed to stop. Then Momoshiki showed up and asked Boruto to switch places with him. As soon as Momoshiki took over Boruto’s mind, he attacked by making a huge Rasengan, which left Code speechless.</p><h2>Expectations From Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 292</h2><p>Boruto episode 292 seems to pick up where episode 291 left off. In the preview for the episode, Kawaki cursed himself for getting himself into this situation and asked for more power.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Add-a-heading-2023-03-15T231947.558.jpg decoding=async alt="Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 292" width=640 height=360 data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>From what I can tell from the preview, Kawaki will probably think about what Amado said about Karma. Kawaki might be able to bring Karma’s power back to life and help settle things. The Momoshiki, on the other hand, took over Boruto’s body. So, Boruto and Kawaki might have to fight each other.</p><p>Also, Naruto and Shikamaru are likely to get there in episode 292 of Boruto. We don’t know how they will react yet, and they don’t have the power to fight Code, let alone Kawaki and Boruto after Otsutsuki fed them.</p><h2>Where To Watch Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 292</h2><p>The second episode of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations will be on Crunchyroll and Funimation, just like the other episodes.</p><h2>Final Words</h2><p>Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 292 will be the second-to-last episode of the first part of the series, ending on March 26, 2023. It will show how Boruto grows as a person and how evil threatens him and his loved ones and changes him.</p><p>Code tried to anger Boruto by stomping on him, but Boruto was able to avoid getting hit and use Momoshiki’s power, giving off a blue aura. Kawaki may be able to bring Karma’s power back to life and help settle things, while Boruto and Kawaki may have to fight each other.</p><p>The article is over now.
