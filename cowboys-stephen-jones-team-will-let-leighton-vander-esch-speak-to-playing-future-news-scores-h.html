The latest could be enough for him to face an early retirement. Per the <i>Fort Worth Star-Telegram's</i> Clarence E. Hill Jr. (h/t Pro Football Talk's <a href=# rel=noopener>Josh Alper</a>), Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones is letting Vander Esch speak on what his next move will be.</p><p>"We'll let Leighton speak to that," Jones said. "It's an injury issue that he's getting his hands around. He'll speak to that."</p><p>Vander Esch was drafted by the Cowboys in 2018 and has spent his entire career in Dallas.</p><p>Vander Esch, the 19th overall pick in the 2018 draft, has enjoyed a successful career given the plethora of injuries. His best season was his rookie year, when he notched 140 tackles and a pair of interceptions, earning a Pro Bowl bid and second-team All-Pro.</p><p>In 2019 after playing nine games, he underwent surgery to repair a nerve issue in his neck, missing the rest of the season. In 2020, he suffered a broken collar that held him to 10 games. Last season, Vander Esch had 30 tackles in six games before his neck injury put him out for the remainder of the year in October.</p><p>Whether or not Vander Esch decides to call it a career, Dallas will be looking to reinforce the linebacker position this offseason. The Cowboys struggled in that area all year, with the problems culminating in their 48-32 wild-card exit to the Green Bay Packers when running back Aaron Jones torched the defense for 118 rushing yards and three touchdowns.</p><p>Dallas has five draft picks and is expected to make moves in free agency to bulk up at linebacker.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWaAc4WMnKawmp%2BuwG6%2F056noZ2eYrewusSsZK2dkaJ6uLXLpWSlnaRiuaa1xqGrqKZdq66vsMSrZJ6rk516tLzEmqJmrJ9iva2t2KKloGWWqsG2vsQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-cassie-p%C3%A9rez-photos-of-chris-p%C3%A9rez-s-daughter-with-venessa-villanueva.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Cassie Prez Photos Of Chris Prezs Daughter With Venessa Villanueva</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./certain-deer-crossword-clue-nyt.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Certain deer Crossword Clue NYT</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./talks-ideas-worth-spreading-series-of-lectures.html>___ Talks (Ideas Worth Spreading series of lectures)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./akili-interactive-announces-board-nominees-ahead-of-spac-and-more-digital-health-hires.html>Akili Interactive announces board nominees ahead of SPAC and more digital health hires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garly-sojo-s-obituary-venezuelan-basketball-player-garly-sojo-passed-away-at-the-age-of-24.html>Garly Sojos obituary: Venezuelan basketball player Garly Sojo passed away at the age of 24</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenzy-wolfe-is-she-still-dylan-larkin-s-girlfriend.html>Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nickname-of-the-16th-us-president.html>Nickname of the 16th US president</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
