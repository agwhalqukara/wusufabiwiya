He has been serving as a coach since 1982 and has gained significant fame. He is currently involved as the head coach at the University of Kentucky. Moreover, he has led his team to win many tournaments and even claimed some prestigious awards.</p><p>The college basketball head coach is a family man and lives a content life with his beloved wife and kids. It surely has been many years of John and his spouse’s marital life, and people want to know the secret behind the long-lasting marriage. Thus, without further ado, let’s look at this article about John Calipari’s wife, <strong>Ellen Calipari</strong>, and some interesting facts about her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Met_While_Working_At_The_University_Of_Kansas></span>Met While Working At The University Of Kansas<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, John is happily married to <strong>Ellen Higgins</strong>. The couple met while working at the University of Kansas. John was serving as an assistant coach for the university’s basketball team, and Ellen served as a secretary in the Kansas athletics office. The pair eventually began dating and got married in 1986.</p><p>It already has been over three decades since the smitten duo shared their vows. Their love has remained the same, and their bond has grown stronger with each day passing. Furthermore, John Calipari’s wife <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">calls him</a> “The Roommate.” She also often shares pictures of him not helping around the house. One such instance was when Ellen shared a video of her hubby taking out the trash and referred to him as “Swaggy Roommate.”</p><p>There are several other posts in which the Calipari couple joke about each other. Furthermore, Mrs. Calipari once revealed how she and her beau don’t take each other too seriously, and Instagram has become her way of giving fans a glimpse into their family life. What’s best than a pair fooling around each other and supporting each other!</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Has_Welcomed_Three_Kids_With_Her_Husband></span>Has Welcomed Three Kids With Her Husband<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, it has been several years since the coach and his partner exchanged the vows. In all these decades of sharing a blissful marital life, the couple has welcomed three kids together.

She makes her own furniture, which looks like it came straight from a catalog. While her husband is away, Ellen seems to have found a way to engage herself.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=John_Is_Her_Second_Husband></span>John Is Her Second Husband<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Ellen is the first wife of the coach, he is her second husband. Before meeting John and marrying him, she shared a marital life with <strong>Nolan Cromwell</strong>. However, it is not known when the former couple tied the knot. Plus, the reason behind their separation has not been revealed yet.</p><p>Ellen Calipari’s ex-hubby is a former NFL player. He became an All-American at Kansas and then played for the LA Rams for ten years from 1977 to 1987. He has achieved significant success in his career.</p><p>Nonetheless, John Calipari’s wife seems to be doing well in her life. She lives comfortably with her husband and children. All in all, we hope Ellen continues living contently.</p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For More Updates On&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Celebrity Babies</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Feuds</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their Riches</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Siblings</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, And&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Keep In Touch With&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>eCelebritymirror.</span></strong></a></p><strong>For More Updates on <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Articles</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Babies</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Feuds</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Siblings</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Entertainment</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Richest Celebrities</a>, Keep In Touch With <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebritymirror.</a></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcLbOoaVmm5GhtrGt0aJksKGWmnqmuMuepWabkaG2sa3RomY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kyle-lowry-charged-with-misdemeanor-battery-on-female-referee-news-scores-highlights-stats-and.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kyle Lowry Charged with Misdemeanor Battery on Female Referee | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./curly-tailed-farm-animal.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Curly-tailed farm animal</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./talks-ideas-worth-spreading-series-of-lectures.html>___ Talks (Ideas Worth Spreading series of lectures)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./akili-interactive-announces-board-nominees-ahead-of-spac-and-more-digital-health-hires.html>Akili Interactive announces board nominees ahead of SPAC and more digital health hires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garly-sojo-s-obituary-venezuelan-basketball-player-garly-sojo-passed-away-at-the-age-of-24.html>Garly Sojos obituary: Venezuelan basketball player Garly Sojo passed away at the age of 24</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenzy-wolfe-is-she-still-dylan-larkin-s-girlfriend.html>Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nickname-of-the-16th-us-president.html>Nickname of the 16th US president</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
