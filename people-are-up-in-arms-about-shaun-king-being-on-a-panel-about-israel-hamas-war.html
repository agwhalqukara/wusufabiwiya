The Morehouse College graduate has also been called out previously for his many fundraising endeavors and accused of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">grifting</a>. King asked his social media followers for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">donations</a> to help him move back in 2021 and requested funds for an alleged nerve condition last May.</p><p>King, journalist Max Blumenthal, marketing director Zeena Aqel, influencer Ahmad Hussam and comedian Tadhg Hickey were the latest guests on the panel, and X users called out King and the panel’s organizers.</p><p>One X user posted a picture of the panel and called King “a serial fraudster who lied about being in contact with the families of Israeli hostages.” Another user wrote, “Why is Shaun King being invited to speak on panels about Palestine? It’s damn near 2024. How is anyone still falling for this man’s scammer bulls—t? It’s infuriating.”</p><p>Some users are calling for him to be canceled.</p><p>Another X user wrote, “I need everyone following me and seeing my tweets and those of people tweeting about Palestine to tell your own followers and mutuals to spread the word about that vile cretin and block Shaun King.

Just warn people and block him.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@Shaunking</a> is not an expert on Palestine.

We all now have a daily glimpse of what it means to live in Gaza. I felt it was my obligation as a non-Palestinian, non-Muslim, a non-Arab American, to advocate for the Palestinians.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e5BrZmptX6WysLzLnmSaqpViuqKwjJqZqK2kYsCprdSnZKShnpx6o7HIp55mp55irm68wKecpWWRl7y2wIyiqquZlaF6qa3Mmqpmr5GnfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./octavius-doctor-octopus-s-name-in-marvel-films.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>___ Octavius (Doctor Octopus's name in Marvel films)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./notre-dame-ad-says-college-football-is-complete-disaster-amid-conference-changes-news-scores-h.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Notre Dame AD Says College Football Is 'Complete Disaster' amid Conference Changes | News, Scores, H</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./talks-ideas-worth-spreading-series-of-lectures.html>___ Talks (Ideas Worth Spreading series of lectures)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./akili-interactive-announces-board-nominees-ahead-of-spac-and-more-digital-health-hires.html>Akili Interactive announces board nominees ahead of SPAC and more digital health hires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garly-sojo-s-obituary-venezuelan-basketball-player-garly-sojo-passed-away-at-the-age-of-24.html>Garly Sojos obituary: Venezuelan basketball player Garly Sojo passed away at the age of 24</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenzy-wolfe-is-she-still-dylan-larkin-s-girlfriend.html>Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nickname-of-the-16th-us-president.html>Nickname of the 16th US president</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
