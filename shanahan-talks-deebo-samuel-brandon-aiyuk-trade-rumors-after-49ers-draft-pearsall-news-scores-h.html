According to ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Nick Wagoner</a>, Aiyuk texted general manager John Lynch and Shanahan to commend them for selecting Pearsall.</p><p>"Fire pick, can't lie," the text read.</p><p>The Pearsall pick could still have an impact on the receiver room, with <i>San Francisco Chronicle's</i> <a href=# rel=noopener>Michael Silver</a> reporting the 49ers "are now more likely to deal Deebo Samuel than they are Brandon Aiyuk."</p><p>It wasn't clear whether San Francisco would trade either of the star receivers, but after their draft selection on Thursday, it seems the 49ers are leaning in that direction.</p><p>The two receivers accounted for much of San Francisco's offensive production last year. Aiyuk had 1,342 receiving yards and seven touchdowns while Samuel had 892 receiving yards and seven touchdowns.</p><p>Aiyuk is currently on a three-year, $12.5 million deal and is set to play on a fifth-year option in 2024. While he would likely get rewarded with a big contract next offseason, Aiyuk is reportedly seeking a bigger deal before the start of the season. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Silver</a>, he is seeking a contract with an annual average "well over" $25 million. If he isn't awarded that, it could lead to a holdout or a trade request.</p><p>Trading Samuel this season could be a financial move for San Francisco. If he is traded this year, it would give the 49ers a $21.7 million dead cap hit but would save them money down the line. It would be hard to replace Samuel's production, but with some added cap space they could sign a receiver to try to do so.</p><p>With Day 2 of the draft looming, a Samuel or Aiyuk trade could be coming soon. It's not clear whether San Francisco will try to leverage either player into picks or trade for an established talent, but it does seem like a trade is on the way.</p><p>In the meantime, the 49ers will look to develop their new wide receiver so he is ready to take on a big role if the team parts ways with one of their star talents.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYW2Dd3yMrJ%2BappGdrq9505qjpKtdmbKmrs5mqpqlpZq5bq7RmqWdp55irqrF1KRkraqRmbJuvtSmpqurXZaztbHRZmtynaKoeqW%2BwJ%2BrZqiVlr%2B0rcul</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bowl-games-2023-24-odds-predictions-and-full-schedule-for-college-football-playoff-news-scores.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bowl Games 2023-24: Odds, Predictions and Full Schedule for College Football Playoff | News, Scores,</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./papoose-and-remy-ma-dress-up-as-zombies-and-fans-are-freaking-out-when-they-see-their-baby-girl.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Papoose And Remy Ma Dress Up As Zombies And Fans Are Freaking Out When They See Their Baby Girl</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./talks-ideas-worth-spreading-series-of-lectures.html>___ Talks (Ideas Worth Spreading series of lectures)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./akili-interactive-announces-board-nominees-ahead-of-spac-and-more-digital-health-hires.html>Akili Interactive announces board nominees ahead of SPAC and more digital health hires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garly-sojo-s-obituary-venezuelan-basketball-player-garly-sojo-passed-away-at-the-age-of-24.html>Garly Sojos obituary: Venezuelan basketball player Garly Sojo passed away at the age of 24</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenzy-wolfe-is-she-still-dylan-larkin-s-girlfriend.html>Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nickname-of-the-16th-us-president.html>Nickname of the 16th US president</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
