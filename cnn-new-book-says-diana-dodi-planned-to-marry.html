It then began braking, went into a skid and hit a pillar in the tunnel while going about 60 mph (96 km/h), the investigator concluded.</p><p>Paul also died in the crash. The sole survivor was bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones.</p><h4>The book also offers other revelations about the tragedy:</h4><ul><li>Under French emergency medical protocols, Diana was treatedat the scene and didn't get to an operating room for an hourand 40 minutes, raising questions about whether the princessmight have survived if she had gotten to the hospital sooner.</li><li>Before the crash, Paul had two drinks at the Ritz Hotel infull view of Dodi Fayed's two bodyguards. One told police hethought Paul was drinking pineapple juice, but the drink wasactually a liqueur called Ricard, mixed with water.</li><li>Tests after the crash showed Paul was legally drunk at thetime of the crash, which investigators say likely contributedto the accident.</li><li>Al-Fayed says he has not ruled out a conspiracy as beingthe cause of the crash. And during a conversation with"Impact," he showed cufflinks belonging to Diana's latefather, the Earl Spencer, which he says she gave to DodiFayed on their final day together as a sign that they wouldbe together "forever."</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZp6cmam2sLqNnKWnZpOkunCjrouDfWdpbX1ze49wZp2hkaOub67OqKJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dakota-johnson-slams-cancel-culture.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dakota Johnson slams cancel culture</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./clyde-s-new-dynamic-drug-duo-forces-stefan-and-ava-to-team-up.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Clydes New Dynamic Drug Duo, Forces Stefan And Ava To Team Up?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./talks-ideas-worth-spreading-series-of-lectures.html>___ Talks (Ideas Worth Spreading series of lectures)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./akili-interactive-announces-board-nominees-ahead-of-spac-and-more-digital-health-hires.html>Akili Interactive announces board nominees ahead of SPAC and more digital health hires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garly-sojo-s-obituary-venezuelan-basketball-player-garly-sojo-passed-away-at-the-age-of-24.html>Garly Sojos obituary: Venezuelan basketball player Garly Sojo passed away at the age of 24</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenzy-wolfe-is-she-still-dylan-larkin-s-girlfriend.html>Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nickname-of-the-16th-us-president.html>Nickname of the 16th US president</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
