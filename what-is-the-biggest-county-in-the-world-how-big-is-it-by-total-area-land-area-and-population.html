Biggest County in the World?</p><p><strong>When we talk about counties, we usually mean the administrative divisions of a country or a state that have some local government functions.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ASS.jpg><p>However, not all countries use the term county for their subdivisions, and some use it for different types of entities.</p><p>For example, in the United Kingdom, a county can be a historic county, a ceremonial county, a metropolitan county, or a non-metropolitan county.</p><p>In China, a county is a level of local government below a province and above a township.</p><p>In Australia, a county is a land division for cadastral purposes but has no administrative or political significance.</p><p>Therefore, to compare the sizes of counties around the world, we need to use a consistent definition and a reliable source of data.</p><p>One possible definition is to use the term county as a synonym for the second-level administrative division of a country, as defined by the <a href=#>ISO 3166-2 standard</a>.</p><p>This standard provides codes for the names of the principal subdivisions of all countries and territories in the world.</p><p>According to this definition, there are more than 4,000 counties in the world, ranging from tiny islands to vast territories.</p><h2><span id=The_Largest_County_by_Total_Area>The Largest County by Total Area</span></h2><p><strong>Using the <a href=#>ISO 3166-2</a> definition and the data from the 2020 U.S. <a href=#>Census Bureau</a>, the largest county in the world by total area is San Bernardino County in California, USA.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sbb.jpg><p>San Bernardino County <strong>covers an area of 20,105 square miles (52,070 square kilometres)</strong>, which is larger than the entire countries of Switzerland, Denmark, or the Netherlands.</p><p>The County is located in the southern part of California, within the Inland Empire area, and has a population of about 2.2 million people.</p><p>The county is known for its natural features, such as the:</p><ul><li>San Bernardino Mountains</li><li>the Mojave Desert</li><li>the Joshua Tree National Park</li></ul><h2><span id=The_Largest_County_in_the_World_by_Land_Area>The Largest County in the World by Land Area</span></h2><p>However, if we only consider the land area of counties, excluding the water area, the ranking changes.</p><p>According to the same source, <strong>the largest county in the world by land area is North Slope Borough in Alaska, USA.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gt.jpg><p>North Slope Borough <strong>has a land area of 88,817 square miles (229,996 square kilometres)</strong>, which is more than four times the size of San Bernardino County.</p><p>North Slope Borough is located in the northernmost part of Alaska, along the Arctic Ocean, and has a population of about 9,800 people.</p><p>The borough is home to:</p><ul><li>the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</li><li>the largest wildlife refuge in the United States</li><li>the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, the largest oil field in North America</li></ul><h2><span id=The_Largest_County_by_Population>The Largest County by Population</span></h2><p>Finally, if we measure the size of counties by their population, the ranking changes again.</p><p>According to the same source, <strong>the largest county in the world by population is Los Angeles County in California, USA Los Angeles County has a population of about 10 million people.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/la.jpg><p>This is more than the entire population of Sweden, Portugal, or Belgium.</p><p>Los Angeles County is located in the southwestern part of California, along the Pacific Ocean, and is the most populous county in the United States.</p><p>The county is the centre of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, one of the largest and most diverse urban areas in the world, and is famous for its entertainment, culture, and economy.</p><h2><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h2><p>In conclusion, the biggest county in the world can be determined by different criteria, such as total area, land area, or population. Depending on the definition and the source of data, the answer may vary.</p><p>However, using the ISO 3166-2 standard and the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau data, we can say that:</p><ul><li>the largest county by total area is San Bernardino County in California</li><li>the largest county by land area is North Slope Borough in Alaska</li><li>the largest county by population is Los Angeles County in California</li></ul><p>These counties are all located in the United States, which has a federal system of government that gives a significant degree of autonomy and responsibility to its counties.</p><p>If you found this article impressive follow for more on our blog as sampled below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifKO1xqCcrKxdmLy2utOyZKKmXam1pnnWqKmlnF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./demi-lovato-launches-new-fabletics-line-part-of-the-proceeds-will-benefit-coronavirus-victims.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Demi Lovato Launches New Fabletics Line &amp;amp; Part Of The Proceeds Will Benefit Coronavirus Victims</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-holly-and-the-christmas-carol.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Holly and the ___ (Christmas carol)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./talks-ideas-worth-spreading-series-of-lectures.html>___ Talks (Ideas Worth Spreading series of lectures)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./akili-interactive-announces-board-nominees-ahead-of-spac-and-more-digital-health-hires.html>Akili Interactive announces board nominees ahead of SPAC and more digital health hires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garly-sojo-s-obituary-venezuelan-basketball-player-garly-sojo-passed-away-at-the-age-of-24.html>Garly Sojos obituary: Venezuelan basketball player Garly Sojo passed away at the age of 24</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenzy-wolfe-is-she-still-dylan-larkin-s-girlfriend.html>Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nickname-of-the-16th-us-president.html>Nickname of the 16th US president</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
