Times have changed and people are more aware of the way sexuality is presented on social media. Some people took issue with the photo as the men were grasping their hands around the women‚Äôs breasts. Sarah herself had a silly look on her face while her fiance smiled behind her as he cupped her breast in his hand. Now, some fans saw nothing wrong with the photo, but there are others who are saying the picture promotes male stereotypes and shouldn‚Äôt have been posted.</p><p>Some followers said that the photo degrades women and treats them as objects for men to ‚Äúmanhandle‚Äù and sets the women‚Äôs rights movement behind.</p><p>Photos like these were very common in the 80s and 90s, but now with the MeToo movement, and in the era of gender equality, some feel the pictures are inappropriate.</p><p>You may see the caption that Sarah Hyland shared with her 6.9 million followers and the controversial photo she posted below.</p><p>‚ÄúWe take wedding photo booths very seriously‚Ä¶ #mcm to the men who love and treat their ladies like queens.‚Äù üë∏üèª üíï</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B4dBoO7lYsg/</p><p>What is your take on the photo? Do you think it is inappropriate when the people involved are clearly consenting to the behavior? Sarah and Wells are engaged to be married. Many defended Sarah and Wells and said that because they are a couple and not only romantically involved but are in love and engaged to be married, MeToo doesn‚Äôt apply to their situation. Sarah Hyland and Wells Adams have been together for two years.</p><p>Still, others said that the very suggestion that men can grab at women in any situation detracts from the work of MeToo. Because women are trying to change stereotypes and the culture of women being viewed upon as sexual objects, the view the photo as further promoting those stereotypes rather than fighting them.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think? Do you think there is something wrong with Sarah Hyland‚Äôs photo or do you think MeToo activists and supporters are taking it too far?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejlr%2BitIyhsKWZnpl6tLTAq5ysZaCdvLW7jLCgraBdm7aiusKeZLCdnKHAbq3DmqSsZZGjsW6%2Fz5qppKtdorK1u85mpq6sopa0pnnAq5xmqJWkva2xjJ%2Bpnpmbnruoec6uq2anppq%2FbrrOrZ%2BippdigHSFk3JqaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-was-jonah-alexander-edwards-tragic-news-the-viral-story-of-jonah-alexander-s-untimely-passing.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Was Jonah Alexander Edwards?Tragic News: The Viral Story of Jonah Alexanders Untimely Passing</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-does-youtube-pay-in-south-africa-with-examples.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>How much does YouTube pay in South Africa (with examples)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./talks-ideas-worth-spreading-series-of-lectures.html>___ Talks (Ideas Worth Spreading series of lectures)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./akili-interactive-announces-board-nominees-ahead-of-spac-and-more-digital-health-hires.html>Akili Interactive announces board nominees ahead of SPAC and more digital health hires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garly-sojo-s-obituary-venezuelan-basketball-player-garly-sojo-passed-away-at-the-age-of-24.html>Garly Sojos obituary: Venezuelan basketball player Garly Sojo passed away at the age of 24</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenzy-wolfe-is-she-still-dylan-larkin-s-girlfriend.html>Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nickname-of-the-16th-us-president.html>Nickname of the 16th US president</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
