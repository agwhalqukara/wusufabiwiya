Shelton – who directed Maron on the Netflix series Glow – passed away on Friday at the age of 54 after collapsing due to an illness (unrelated to COVID-19).</p><p>In a statement released to Indiewire, Maron shared the “awful news” and said that Shelton had a previously unknown, underlying condition. He explained that the doctors couldn’t save her even though they tried.</p><p>https://twitter.com/mindykaling/status/1261747375288102913</p><p>“I loved her very much as I know many of you did as well. It’s devastating. I am leveled, heartbroken and in complete shock and don’t really know how to move forward in this moment,” said Maron. “She was a beautiful, kind, loving, charismatic artist. Her spirit was pure joy. She made me happy. I made her happy. We were happy. I made her laugh all the time. We laughed a lot. We were starting a life together. I really can’t believe what is happening. This is a horrendous, sad loss.”</p><p>Shelton had a successful career as a director in Hollywood. The Seattle native’s first film was 2006’s We Go Way Back and she also directed 2009’s Humpday. She wrote and directed a total of eight films during her career, including 2019’s Sword of Trust, which starred Maron.</p><p>Her TV directing credits include Mad Men, Master of None, Fresh Off the Boat, The Mindy Project, New Girl, Little Fires Everywhere, and The Morning Show.</p><p>The news of Shelton’s death has resulted in numerous celebrities taking to Twitter and Instagram to express their sadness and to honor Shelton’s memory. Mark Duplass worked with Shelton often, and he wrote that her “boundless creative energy and infectious spirit were unrivaled.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CAQ3op5gqnd/</p><p>Mindy Kaling echoed the statement, writing that Shelton’s energy was infectious and actors always “drifted to video village between takes to be around her.” Reese Witherspoon wrote that she was “devastated” to hear about Shelton’s passing, and she was in “complete shock” to find out that the “vibrant, talented, and soulful filmmaker is no longer with us.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Lynn Shelton is survived by her former husband of eight years, Kevin Seal, and their son Milo.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGedlr%2BkecyaqaimXai9pq3KrGSoraRirqO71K1krK2UmbKvecOemK2gXaSzbrPIq6Ofqpmau6V5y7Klp2WjnbKtwM6nZKyZqah6qbHSZp%2BemaKpr7O7yp6lZmtpbX16gI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./missing-splinter-spark-of-dreams.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Missing Splinter Spark of Dreams</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-henry-cavill-married-does-he-have-wife-girlfriend-or-kids.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Henry Cavill Married?
