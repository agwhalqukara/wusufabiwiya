Meghan isn’t used to the extreme spotlight she’s been living under and Prince Harry has always been a bit of a wildcard. The two have been accused of being rebellious and as they have now been married for over a year and have their son Archie, the pressure has been mounting against the couple.</p><p>Meghan and Prince Harry are on a break for about six weeks where they are reportedly in the United States and spending time with Meghan’s family and close friends.&nbsp; Now, the latest reports are saying that Meghan is tired of being a royal and regrets giving up her Hollywood career for Harry.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Close family? So basically, <a href=# rel=nofollow>#meghanmarkle</a> and prince harry spent thanksgiving with Doria. <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/JDLjIS20RA</a></p><p>— I see what you did there (@YourPRsuxxx) <a href=# rel=nofollow>December 3, 2019</a></p><p>There is nothing that would remotely indicate that this is the case, but it’s being reported across social media. Now, a new report by OK! Magazine says that Meghan wants to start directing and while she’s in the United States, is trying to set up a run-in with award-winning directors such as Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg.</p><p>According to OK! Magazine, Meghan wants to connect to a lot of Hollywood A-listers but most specifically, she wants to connect to Eastwood and Spielberg to help kick-start her directing career.</p><p>OK! Magazine quoted a source who stated the following.</p><p>“Initially, Meghan gave up her career for Harry, but she’s been thinking about returning to Hollywood someday as a director, either for a big-budget movie or a documentary. A meeting with Clint or Steven could help get that off the ground.”</p><p>Again, there is nothing to indicate the report is true; however, if it was, Meghan could make a lot of leeway as a director — especially if she focused on documentaries.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>There seems to be nothing traditional about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, but do you think she’s trying to leave her royal duties to the wayside permanently so that she can work as a Hollywood director?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeZqHquscahmKdlnZa%2FrLjEZqursZmjtG7Azmarq5mToHqlu9anZJykmaPBbrHArKuwp5%2BZeqK6w2aqrZ2mmrtuv8%2BinKWalae0bsDOZqOarZ6YtW60xKtknJmimrKzecCsZJpllJ6%2Fpq%2FTqKlma2Rsf3p9jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./late-activist-ryan-carson-public-interest-soars-as-tragic-demise-and-viral-video-reveal-surprising.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Late Activist Ryan Carson: Public Interest Soars as Tragic Demise and Viral Video Reveal Surprising</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fails-big-time-7-little-words-answers-with-5-letters.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fails, big-time 7 Little Words Answers with 5 letters</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./talks-ideas-worth-spreading-series-of-lectures.html>___ Talks (Ideas Worth Spreading series of lectures)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./akili-interactive-announces-board-nominees-ahead-of-spac-and-more-digital-health-hires.html>Akili Interactive announces board nominees ahead of SPAC and more digital health hires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garly-sojo-s-obituary-venezuelan-basketball-player-garly-sojo-passed-away-at-the-age-of-24.html>Garly Sojos obituary: Venezuelan basketball player Garly Sojo passed away at the age of 24</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenzy-wolfe-is-she-still-dylan-larkin-s-girlfriend.html>Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nickname-of-the-16th-us-president.html>Nickname of the 16th US president</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
