Fans were in a tizzy on Monday, July 20, after Good Morning America welcomed <strong>Jake Gyllenhaal</strong> to the show as his ex-girlfriend <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>'s hit song "Bad Blood" played in the background — but Gyllenhaal himself says he wasn't at all fazed by the coincidence. In fact, he told <strong>Howard Stern</strong> on Wednesday that he didn't even notice.</p><p>The shock jock brought up the incident during an interview with the Southpaw actor, 34, on his SiriusXM radio show, pointing out that it was a "big deal" on social media. "Were you aware of that?" he asked.&nbsp;</p><p>Gyllenhaal replied with a laugh and a simple "no," then went on to add, "First of all, I did not hear that. When I'm doing an interview, when you are up at 5 a.m. and you can't make sense of words, you're not thinking about the background music that's playing behind you."</p><p>Stern joked that the show's producers were "up to shenanigans" and played the song on purpose to "make some sort of association." But Gyllenhaal didn't take the bait.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm sure they have so much music on that show playing all the time," he demurred. "It's just one of those things."</p><p>Stern continued to press the star about his relationship with the "Style" singer, 25, whom Gyllenhaal dated briefly in 2011, and who's now hot and heavy with Scottish DJ Calvin Harris. "I feel — and this is me stepping in — you should have married Taylor Swift, and I'll tell you why," he said. "What a power couple!"&nbsp;</p><p>He continued: "I would have said, 'Jake, this is The One.' Because to me, nothing is sexier than a woman who can play songs and write."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Gyllenhaal, for his part, had nothing but nice things to say about the pop sensation, telling Stern she's a "beautiful girl."</p><p>He played dumb, though, when Stern's co-host Robin Quivers asked about the song Swift had written about him — "All Too Well," from her 2012 album Red.</p><p>"Do I [have a song]? I don't know," he quipped.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGao5VitLq4y56loZmRoXqxuMCyqmabn656oq7OrqtmnahitKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXq1rdilpqtlo6y2p8CMa2dqbWJohA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-adam-devine-sister-brittani-devine-siblings-and-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Adam Devine Sister Brittani DeVine, Siblings And Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./frankie-bridge-wins-cybersmile-award-for-raising-awareness-of-mental-health.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Frankie Bridge wins Cybersmile award for raising awareness of Mental Health</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./talks-ideas-worth-spreading-series-of-lectures.html>___ Talks (Ideas Worth Spreading series of lectures)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./akili-interactive-announces-board-nominees-ahead-of-spac-and-more-digital-health-hires.html>Akili Interactive announces board nominees ahead of SPAC and more digital health hires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garly-sojo-s-obituary-venezuelan-basketball-player-garly-sojo-passed-away-at-the-age-of-24.html>Garly Sojos obituary: Venezuelan basketball player Garly Sojo passed away at the age of 24</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenzy-wolfe-is-she-still-dylan-larkin-s-girlfriend.html>Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nickname-of-the-16th-us-president.html>Nickname of the 16th US president</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
