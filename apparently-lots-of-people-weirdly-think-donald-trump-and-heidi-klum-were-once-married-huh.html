Apparently, lots of people somehow think <a href=#>Heidi Klum</a> and <a href=#>Donald Trump</a> were once <a href=#>married</a>. Yes, seriously. The gossip is truly strange and, frankly, we’re not even totally sure where it came from. But, let’s take a step back and investigate, shall we?</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Heidi Klum Reveals She Wants to be Topless on the Beach When She’s 60!</a></p><p>First, it seems Heidi, 44, and the POTUS, 71, have been close friends for years. We can infer the two probably hung out in the same celebrity circles in Hollywood. Plus, Heidi and <a href=#>Donald’s wife, Melania Trump</a>, 47, both worked as international supermodels (it’s casual), so we’re sure the America’s Got Talent judge and the First Lady are old pals too. Interestingly, both Donald and Heidi also have sons who are the same age —&nbsp;Donald and Melania’s only child, Barron, is 11 years old and Heidi and her ex-husband Seal’s eldest son, Henry, is also 11. Maybe they’ve had play dates!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/donald-trump-heidi-klum.jpg><p>Melania, Donald, and Heidi in 2008. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)</p><p>Just to reiterate, Donald and Heidi have definitely never been married. Heidi was first hitched to actor Ric Pipino from 1997 until 2002. She then dated Italian businessman Flavio Briatore and the two <a href=#>welcomed daughter Leni together in May 2004</a>. After the model and Flavio split, Heidi famously began dating singer Seal and the duo had three kids together, sons Henry and Johan and daughter Lou. Seal also adopted Leni during their marriage. The former power couple divorced in 2015 and Heidi is now <a href=#>dating art curator Vito Schnabel</a>.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Heidi Klum Opens Up About Her Divorce From Seal —&nbsp;“It’s Been a Roller Coaster”</a></p><p>Donald has tied the knot three times, but never with Heidi. He was <a href=#>married to model Ivana Trump</a> —&nbsp;with whom he has kids Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric —&nbsp;from 1997 until 1992. He was then hitched to actress Marla Maples from 1993 until 1999 and they had daughter Tiffany during their marriage. He exchanged vows with current wife, Melania, in 2005.</p><p>While we know Heidi and Donald were seemingly one close pals, we’re frankly not sure the two remain on good terms today. Back in 2015, Donald slammed Heidi during a <a href=#>New York Times</a> interview. “Heidi Klum… sadly, she’s no longer a 10,” he said, bashing the mom-of-four’s looks. Heidi later hit back at Donald during a sit-down on <a href=#>The Ellen Show</a>. “I mean, who even is a 10? No one’s a 10,” she said. Go, girl!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e5BqZLKdkad6sLjDZqapnaKWerS1zaCcq2WXmsG0edKtmKecmaO0brvVmquip55is7O7zGahrpyXmnqpscidoGajnKq6brDUq6Cnn12Wuqa%2ByJyYZqtdnLy1edOao56mpGKutrDIraCopl1rfnh8lw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chad-doerman-wife-exploring-the-personal-life-of-a-noteworthy-individual.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chad Doerman Wife: Exploring the Personal Life of a Noteworthy Individual</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./matt-araiza-the-rising-star-s-age-family-background-and-net-worth-revealed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Matt Araiza: The Rising Stars Age, Family Background, and Net Worth Revealed</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./talks-ideas-worth-spreading-series-of-lectures.html>___ Talks (Ideas Worth Spreading series of lectures)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./akili-interactive-announces-board-nominees-ahead-of-spac-and-more-digital-health-hires.html>Akili Interactive announces board nominees ahead of SPAC and more digital health hires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garly-sojo-s-obituary-venezuelan-basketball-player-garly-sojo-passed-away-at-the-age-of-24.html>Garly Sojos obituary: Venezuelan basketball player Garly Sojo passed away at the age of 24</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenzy-wolfe-is-she-still-dylan-larkin-s-girlfriend.html>Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nickname-of-the-16th-us-president.html>Nickname of the 16th US president</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
