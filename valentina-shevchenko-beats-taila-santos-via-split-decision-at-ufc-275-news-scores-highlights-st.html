She was once again able to get the fight to the ground and held top position. Despite a gogoplata attempt from the champ, she held control over much of the round.</p><p>Santos met some unfortunate adversity in the fourth round. As Shevchenko started a combination, the two combatants butted heads and Santos' eye swelled shut as a result.</p>UFC <span class=acct>@ufc</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Time for the fifth and final round!&lt;br>&lt;br>[ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UFC275?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UFC275&lt;/a> | Live on ESPN+ PPV: &lt;a href="https://t.co/IEu8bU0BAa">https://t.co/IEu8bU0BAa&lt;/a> ] &lt;a href="https://t.co/bycZdK5PwP">pic.twitter.com/bycZdK5PwP&lt;/a></p><p>The fifth round saw both fighters have their moments. The competitive round put an inconclusive end to a fight that wasn't an easy one to score.</p><p>It's been established throughout Bullet's reign as the flyweight champion that she is the best fighter in the weight class.</p><p>Her win over Santos gives her seven consecutive title defenses. That run has included wins over Joanna Jedrzejczyk, Katlyn Chookagian and Jessica Andrade.</p><p>Of course, when someone has dominated a division for as long as she has, the next question inevitably becomes centered on a superfight. Shevchenko has already fought former bantamweight champion Amanda Nunes twice.</p><p>Her two losses to the Lioness are the only ones under the UFC banner. This win may have set up a trilogy if Nunes hadn't fought for the title, but Shevchenko has already spoken on the possibility of fighting current champion Julianna Pena.</p><p>“Definitely Julianna has all the chances to win, but if Amanda is gonna be in the same fight shape as when she fought me, I think she will get back her belt, and we are gonna still come back for this third fight,” Shevchenko said, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Nicolas Atkin</a> of the <i>South China Morning Post</i>. “Either way I don’t care really. I can fight both of them at the same time, like whatever."</p><p>At this point, a fight with whoever is holding the bantamweight belt after Pena and Nunes' rematch is the only obvious answer for who Shevchenko should see next. She's proved time and time again to be too much for the contenders at 125 pounds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloY22BdX%2BMr5ilnZ6ptq%2BtjKyfnq6TnbKvt85mmZ6ZpKh6ta3IpZhmq5GjwbC%2FjK%2BgmmWjpbmqwIydnJyho568r3nArWSunpNif3iB</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brian-cox-explains-why-he-turned-down-role-in-game-of-thrones.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brian Cox Explains Why He Turned Down Role in Game of Thrones</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./power-ranking-top-50-funniest-fantasy-baseball-team-names-news-scores-highlights-stats-and-rum.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Power Ranking Top 50 Funniest Fantasy Baseball Team Names | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rum</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./talks-ideas-worth-spreading-series-of-lectures.html>___ Talks (Ideas Worth Spreading series of lectures)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./akili-interactive-announces-board-nominees-ahead-of-spac-and-more-digital-health-hires.html>Akili Interactive announces board nominees ahead of SPAC and more digital health hires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garly-sojo-s-obituary-venezuelan-basketball-player-garly-sojo-passed-away-at-the-age-of-24.html>Garly Sojos obituary: Venezuelan basketball player Garly Sojo passed away at the age of 24</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenzy-wolfe-is-she-still-dylan-larkin-s-girlfriend.html>Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nickname-of-the-16th-us-president.html>Nickname of the 16th US president</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
