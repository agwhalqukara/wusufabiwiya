On June 10, fans watched in tears as Chad DiMera (Billy Flynn) discovered his wife’s slain body. Now the big question is who murdered the beloved heroine. A long list of suspects has emerged, including Sarah Horton (Linsey Godfrey).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Days-of-Our-Lives-Sarah-1200x800.jpg><h2 id=h-sarah-horton-is-the-latest-suspect-in-abigail-deveraux-s-murder-on-days-of-our-lives>Sarah Horton is the latest suspect in Abigail Deveraux’s murder on ‘Days of Our Lives’</h2><p>Abigail’s murder has unleashed many suspects on Days of Our Lives. Although <a href=#>Abigail was Salem’s beloved good girl</a>, there were a lot of people who wanted her dead. Last week, a huge and unexpected break came in the investigation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Days of Our Lives’ Speculation: Abby Killed in Gruesome Murder Mystery</a></strong></p><p>Chad was certain Lucas Horton (Bryan Dattilo) was the culprit because Abigail was working on a story that would expose <a href=#>Lucas as Sami Brady’s (Alison Sweeney) kidnapper</a>. Lucas blacked out the night of the murder, but while under hypnosis from Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall), he remembered a critical detail. Lucas recalled seeing Sarah at the DiMera mansion at the same time Abigail was murdered.</p><p>With the new lead, police disrupted Sarah and Xander Kiriakis’ (Paul Telfer) wedding to bring her in for questioning. It’s already been a rough year for Sarah, and being accused of murder adds to her list of problems.</p><h2 id=h-sarah-horton-s-hallucinations-have-caused-her-to-act-strange>Sarah Horton’s hallucinations have caused her to act strange</h2><p>Since Sarah’s return to Days of Our Lives, her life has been filled with setbacks. Sarah and Abigail were held captive on an island by Kristen DiMera (Stacy Haiduk). They were rescued and <a href=#>returned to Salem, but Sarah had memory loss</a> and thought she was Renee DuMonde (Philece Sampler).</p><p>Xander and Maggie Horton (Suzanne Rogers) worked to bring back Sarah’s memory. With the help of Dr. Rolf’s (Richard Wharton) drug, Sarah slowly regained her memory. However, there were side effects to the medication.</p><p>Sarah’s been having hallucinations which caused her to lash out at others. She had a heated confrontation with Nicole Walker (Arianne Zucker), then later pulled a knife on Chanel Dupree (Raven Bowens). So is it possible she could’ve accidentally killed Abigail during one of her spells?</p><h2 id=h-is-abigail-deveraux-s-killer-still-on-the-loose-on-days-of-our-lives>Is Abigail Deveraux’s killer still on the loose on ‘Days of Our Lives’?</h2><p>Sarah is the number one suspect in Abigail’s murder on Days of Our Lives. While Sarah claims she’s innocent, she’s beginning to question her guilt. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Soaps.com</a>, Sarah and Xander seek Marlena’s help in determining what happened that night. However, the hypnosis session leaves them with more questions than answers.</p><p>As Xander tries to help Sarah prove her innocence, many fans believe she’s being framed, and the real killer is still at large. Gwen Rizczech (Emily O’Brien) is Sarah’s biggest rival and <a href=#>tries to split up her and Xander</a>. Could Gwen’s latest attempt involve framing Sarah for murder?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Also, one can’t rule out Gwen’s pal Kristen. At one point, Kristen paraded around in a Sarah mask to wreak havoc in her life. Although Gwen and Kristen were in prison at the time of Abigail’s murder, they have resources. The two women could’ve used an accomplice to kill Abigail and frame Sarah.</p><p>The <a href=#>Abigail murder mystery is far from over</a>. There will be more questions and clues as the storyline draws out. Did a Salem resident kill the adored heroine? Or is Abigail’s killer someone fans don’t know?</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Days of Our Lives’ Star Billy Flynn Agrees With Decision to Kill Abby</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOoqpmq5Gnrql50Z6qqaeeqLajuMRmnaiqXZavqrPAoqOsZZSarrW0jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joe-klocek-age-height-wikipedia-girlfriend-instagram-net-worth-2022-movies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Joe Klocek Age, Height, Wikipedia, Girlfriend, Instagram, Net Worth 2022, Movies</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./incident-leaves-woman-injured-in-the-leg.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Incident Leaves Woman Injured in the Leg</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./talks-ideas-worth-spreading-series-of-lectures.html>___ Talks (Ideas Worth Spreading series of lectures)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./akili-interactive-announces-board-nominees-ahead-of-spac-and-more-digital-health-hires.html>Akili Interactive announces board nominees ahead of SPAC and more digital health hires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garly-sojo-s-obituary-venezuelan-basketball-player-garly-sojo-passed-away-at-the-age-of-24.html>Garly Sojos obituary: Venezuelan basketball player Garly Sojo passed away at the age of 24</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenzy-wolfe-is-she-still-dylan-larkin-s-girlfriend.html>Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nickname-of-the-16th-us-president.html>Nickname of the 16th US president</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
