In recent years, the star has added ‘husband and father’ to his list of titles. He’s also a serial homeowner. So, where does Joe Jonas live these days?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Joe Jonas lives in a six-bedroom house in the Bay Point area of Miami with his wife and child. Before moving to Miami, Joe has lived in California’s Encino and Sherman Oaks areas, West Hollywood, Los Angeles, and Dallas-Fort Worth.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebanswers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/shutterstock_587599115.jpg><p>Do you want to know where Joe Jonas spends his downtime? Are you eager to find out if, like he was with the ‘Love Bug,’ Joe has been bitten by the property bug? Is Joe’s property portfolio of interest to you? No matter what brought you here, you’ll find what you’re looking for in today’s article.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where Does Joe Jonas Live?&nbsp;</h2><p>Joe, together with his wife Sophie Turner and their daughter Willa, lives in the Bay Point area of Miami. The area is <a href=# rel=noopener>popular amongst celebrities</a>, with the likes of Enrique Iglesias, Anna Kournikova, Willy Chirino, Karlie Kloss, <a href=#>Ivanka Trump</a>, and Livan Hernandez all calling Bay Point ‘home.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Jonas brother and his Game Of Thrones star wife purchased the property in 2019 for a whopping USD $11 million. The 10,400 square-foot property boasts a 10-foot deep swimming pool, a koi pond, and a private stretch of beach spanning 94 feet.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The house itself has six bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a climate-controlled wine cellar, a gym, a spa, sauna, and steam room, as well as several indoor gardens and an atrium.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Happened To Joe Jonas And Sophie Turner’s Old House?</h2><p>When Joe and Sophie married in May of 2019, one of the first things they did as a married couple was club together and purchase a home. Their marital property was located in Encino, California, and set them back a cool USD $14.1 million.&nbsp;</p><p>The 15,000 square-foot house, which was located just three short miles from the home that <a href=#>Nick Jonas</a> and <a href=#>Priyanka Chopra</a> own, sits on an acre of lush green land. It has ten bedrooms, fourteen bathrooms, a climate-controlled walk-in wine cellar, and floor-to-ceiling glass windows.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Outside is a fully-kitted outdoor entertainment area, a sunbathing area, a built-in barbeque, a fire pit, manicured lawns, and an ancient oak tree. There’s also a two-bedroom guest house complete with a cigar humidor, aquarium, wine cellar, lap pool, and spa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It was a truly stunning property that served as the perfect base for the couple to start their wedded life. However, in June of 2021, with their one-year-old daughter Willa in tow, the couple sold the property to DJ Zedd for USD $15.2 million and purchased the family home they live in today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joe Jonas’s Property Portfolio</h2><p>Though Joe’s recent property buying and selling adventure is interesting enough, he has owned three remarkable homes in the past. He has a pretty impressive <a href=# rel=noopener>property portfolio</a> history and purchased his first home when he was just 19 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>Three years after making it big time, Joe and his brothers Kevin and Nick Jonas purchased a USD $2.8 million 7,500 square-foot house together. This six-bedroom house is located in the leafy Westlake suburb of Dallas-Fort Worth and as Nick was just 16 years old at the time, the brothers had to ask their mother, Denise Jonas, to complete the transaction on their behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In May of 2014, Joe purchased a USD $2.6 million West Hollywood home. The property boasts 2,900 square feet of living space, four bedrooms, five bathrooms, an outdoor entertainment area, and a swimming pool. He sold the property for USD $2.9 million in November of 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>After selling his West Hollywood home, Joe rented an estate in Runyon Canyon, Los Angeles for a whopping USD $3,500 per night. The home has seven bedrooms, a movie theatre, floor-to-ceiling windows, and breathtaking views.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 2016, Joe purchased a modern farmhouse in the Sherman Oaks area of California for USD $3.7 million. The house, which is known as ‘Sutton House’, sits on 5,600 square feet and has four bedrooms, a movie theatre, a heated pool, and a guest house. He sold it in 2018 for USD $3.7 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfnqqVYrGwsdJmoaidXZ%2B8r63SZqOirpVk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-to-watch-coraline-right-now-can-you-watch-the-anime-for-free.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where to watch Coraline right now | Can you watch the anime for free?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-walters-share-indie-pop-gem-stuck-in-my-ways.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Walters Share Indie Pop Gem &amp;quot;Stuck In My Ways&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./talks-ideas-worth-spreading-series-of-lectures.html>___ Talks (Ideas Worth Spreading series of lectures)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./akili-interactive-announces-board-nominees-ahead-of-spac-and-more-digital-health-hires.html>Akili Interactive announces board nominees ahead of SPAC and more digital health hires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garly-sojo-s-obituary-venezuelan-basketball-player-garly-sojo-passed-away-at-the-age-of-24.html>Garly Sojos obituary: Venezuelan basketball player Garly Sojo passed away at the age of 24</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenzy-wolfe-is-she-still-dylan-larkin-s-girlfriend.html>Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nickname-of-the-16th-us-president.html>Nickname of the 16th US president</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
