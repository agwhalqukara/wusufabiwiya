In an interview, Petras shared the unique circumstances surrounding the procedure, revealing that health insurance covered the entire cost due to her officially diagnosed condition as a transgender individual.</p><p>The process was facilitated by the confirmation of her transgender identity by two psychiatrists at the Frankfurt Hospital, who played a crucial role in approving the surgery at such a tender age.
