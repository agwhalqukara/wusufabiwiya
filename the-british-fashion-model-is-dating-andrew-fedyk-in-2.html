White, who is known for her fashion videos in which she creatively customizes old items from her wardrobe, purchased a gray jumpsuit from the brand's Spring/Summer 2023 collection for <strong>$2,100</strong>.</p><p>While most people would treat a designer garment with care, White had other ideas. She took a pair of scissors and slashed the onesie down the center, transforming it into a tiny crop top and miniskirt à la <strong>Julia Fox</strong> (the Miu Miu set is shaking). White repurposed the legs of the jumpsuit as leg warmers, wasting no fabric.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>And to cut into a garment designed by <strong>Miuccia Prada</strong> and <strong>Raf Simons</strong> was certainly a bold move on White's part — and her decision to take scissors to brand-new Prada has elicited mixed reactions online. While some praise the influencer's DIY outfit, others criticize its raw edges, calling them messy and cheap-looking.</p><p><strong>Visit&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a>&nbsp;about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGikmpyVobKqusRmrqGhpJp6o7vYn6minZ6ZfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./three-month-old-baby-says-i-love-you-to-shocked-father.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Three-Month-Old Baby Says I Love You to Shocked Father</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ramon-estevez-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ramon Estevez Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./talks-ideas-worth-spreading-series-of-lectures.html>___ Talks (Ideas Worth Spreading series of lectures)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./akili-interactive-announces-board-nominees-ahead-of-spac-and-more-digital-health-hires.html>Akili Interactive announces board nominees ahead of SPAC and more digital health hires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garly-sojo-s-obituary-venezuelan-basketball-player-garly-sojo-passed-away-at-the-age-of-24.html>Garly Sojos obituary: Venezuelan basketball player Garly Sojo passed away at the age of 24</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenzy-wolfe-is-she-still-dylan-larkin-s-girlfriend.html>Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nickname-of-the-16th-us-president.html>Nickname of the 16th US president</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
