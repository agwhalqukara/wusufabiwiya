"Valium, Ambien, the numbers got so high I don't even know what I'm taking," he told Vibe magazine after his rehab stint.</p><p>Now, in the new documentary, the 40-year-old reveals that his prescription drug abuse nearly killed him.&nbsp;"My bottom was going to be death," he says in the <a href=#>film excerpt on YouTube</a>. Recalling the first time he had Vicodin, he explained it was a "feeling of 'Ahhh,' everything was not only mellow, but didn't feel any pain. It just kind of numbed things."</p><p>The Detroit native said that it was hard for him to realize that he had a problem since he wasn't abusing drugs like crack or heroin.</p><p>"I don't know what point exactly it started to be a problem, I just remember liking it more and more," he explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If friends tried to tell him to get help, "I would say, 'Get that f—— person outta here, I can't believe they said that shit to me,'" he recalled. "'They don't know nothing about my f—— life, are they out of their f—— mind? I'm not out there shooting heroin, I'm not out there putting coke up my nose, I'm not smoking crack' … I literally thought I could control it."</p><p>The abuse did catch up to him, though, as he reveals his scary brush with death when he was hospitalized following an overdose.</p><p>"Had I got to the hospital about two hours later, I would have died," he said. "My organs were shutting down. My liver, kidneys, everything. They were gonna have to put me on dialysis, they didn’t think I was gonna make it."</p><p>Once leaving the hospital, Eminem says that he didn't sleep for three weeks and relapsed a month later. "I remember just walking around my house and thinking every single day, like, I'm gonna fucking die. I'm looking at my kids, and like, I need to be here for this."</p><p>Explaining that he had to regain his motor skills and talking skills, the Grammy-award winner shared that's come a long way since his days of drug abuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"It's been a learning process," he said. "I'm growing. I just couldn’t believe that anybody could be naturally happy or naturally function or be just enjoying life in general without being on something."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He added, "So I would say to anybody, 'It does get better, you know. It just does.'"</p><p>Eminem is dad to Hailie Jade Scott, 17, whom he had with ex Kimberly Scott. They divorced in 2006. He also has adopted two other daughters: Alaina "Lainie" Mathers, the child of Scott's sister, and Whitney, Scott's child from a previous relationship.</p><p>The film, which opened on June 29, also features interviews with<strong> Russell Simmons</strong> and <strong>Woody Harrelson</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJymoZ6aum7AwKWirGWglsC1ecOrrKBlpaiybrWMsKaupJRitaLCxGabop2UYn9xfZJrcG8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jimmy-butler-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-career-nationality.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jimmy Butler- Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Career, Nationality</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./elaine-chappelle-wiki-biography-age-height-husband-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Elaine Chappelle Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./talks-ideas-worth-spreading-series-of-lectures.html>___ Talks (Ideas Worth Spreading series of lectures)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./akili-interactive-announces-board-nominees-ahead-of-spac-and-more-digital-health-hires.html>Akili Interactive announces board nominees ahead of SPAC and more digital health hires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garly-sojo-s-obituary-venezuelan-basketball-player-garly-sojo-passed-away-at-the-age-of-24.html>Garly Sojos obituary: Venezuelan basketball player Garly Sojo passed away at the age of 24</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenzy-wolfe-is-she-still-dylan-larkin-s-girlfriend.html>Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nickname-of-the-16th-us-president.html>Nickname of the 16th US president</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
