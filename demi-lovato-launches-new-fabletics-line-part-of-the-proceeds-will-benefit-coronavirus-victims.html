Lovato says that she designed the collection to uplift her customers with bold colors and amazing contouring “for the biggest confidence boost.”</p><p>Standouts from the line include Blare Impact Sports Bras (one with a zipper and one without) for $59.95 each, High-Waisted PowerHold leggings that range in price from $69.95 to $79.95, and High-Waisted pocket capris for $64.95.</p><p>Lovato says that the $5 from each item she sells will provide “crucial gear to frontline workers.” She is donating the money from sales between now and June 30th.</p><p>On Instagram, Lovato wrote that she had been working hard behind-the-scenes for several months on the new Fabletic line, and she has been eager to share it. However, watching the world change over the past several weeks made her think hard about launching the new line on April 2nd.</p><p>https://twitter.com/12ylovaticheart/status/1245409926341591041</p><p>After a lot of thought, Lovato says that they decided to move forward, but added the twist of a $5 donation for each piece sold to help those on the front line who are in need during this troubling time.</p><p>Demi Lovato added that it is important for everyone to feel empowered, invincible, and strong from the inside out during this pandemic, and her collection is designed to do just that. She says that the styles make you feel supported when you put them on, and living an active life at home is all about wearing activewear.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>She concluded her message by asking her 79.5 million followers to join her in projecting positivity, building inner strength, and boosting each other up during the pandemic. She added that this is the perfect opportunity to help people in the community who need it most during this extraordinary time.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUmrqqecuorZqsn2K5osHNnJ%2Beq12jsrh5xZqZpZ2knrC0ecuipZ5loJa%2FtXnOn2StoJVivbO7wp6cnatdrLatuIybnKedlp7Bbq%2FOq6anmaaev7a%2FjK%2BgnKyZosBuf5dtZ25wXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./thomas-sirk-injury-updates-on-duke-qb-s-recovery-from-achilles-surgery-news-scores-highlights.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Thomas Sirk Injury: Updates on Duke QB's Recovery from Achilles Surgery | News, Scores, Highlights,</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-the-biggest-county-in-the-world-how-big-is-it-by-total-area-land-area-and-population.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is the Biggest County in the World?
