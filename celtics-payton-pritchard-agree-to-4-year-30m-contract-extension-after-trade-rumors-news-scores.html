He was eligible for restricted free agency in 2024, and he was staring at a stacked backcourt, one in which he was struggling to carve out a role.</p><p>Pritchard's 48 appearances and 13.4 minutes per game were both the lowest of his career, and he logged a total of 57 minutes in the postseason.</p><p>Then came an offseason that dramatically altered the Celtics roster and Pritchard's position within it.</p><p>Out went Marcus Smart in the trade for Kristaps Porziņģis, and then Malcolm Brogdon was included in the deal to land Jrue Holiday. That Pritchard stuck around through the transformation seemingly symbolized a strong endorsement from the team, and he became the No. 3 guard behind Holiday and Derrick White.</p>Jack Simone <span class=acct>@JackSimoneNBA</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Payton Pritchard on a potential expanded role for Celtics &lt;a href="https://t.co/HYaaC4tXff">pic.twitter.com/HYaaC4tXff&lt;/a></p>Hardwood Paroxysm <span class=acct>@HPbasketball</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>The funniest part of this is that Pritchard wanted a trade because he wasn't getting playing time and now all the guys in front of him are gone. &lt;br>&lt;br>Is Payton Pritchard a warlock/</p><p>The 2020 first-round pick will always be limited somewhat by his size, and he's not an explosive athlete. Because of that, it's difficult to envision him making a major breakthrough, not unlike the one Jalen Brunson enjoyed in his final year with the Dallas Mavericks in 2021-22.</p><p>But Pritchard has shown enough to think he can become a very good backup point guard or spot starter.</p><p>Through his first three years, he averaged 15.1 points, 4.7 rebounds and 4.0 assists per 36 minutes, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Basketball Reference</a>. His jumper has steadily improved as well, to the point where he knocked down 40 percent of his long-range opportunities in 2022-23.<br></p><p>Because he's still somewhat unproven in a higher-usage role, one wondered whether Pritchard would wait until next summer before he seriously considered signing an extension.</p><p>Going back to the Brunson example, he <a href=#>could've signed</a> for four years and $55.5 million if the Mavs had offered it, and instead he penned a <a href=# rel=noopener>four-year, $104 million</a> deal with the New York Knicks months later.</p><p>It's doubtful that kind of payday would've been forthcoming for Pritchard under any circumstances, but he could easily outperform his new contract and come to regret not waiting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ22Gc4GMnJylrJmYwG68wLKrqKZdpb%2BqwMKhmKucXZa0s7HEZquoZWRixqat0WZqaaVdmLyvwNGamq1lla3BprrSoqanZZGbwaa%2BjK2pmpyVYr%2B2uc6rqg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dre-london-entrepreneur-age-birthday-bio-facts-family-net-worth-height-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dre London (Entrepreneur) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./track-by-track-album-review-milk-sugar-20-years-of-milk-sugar.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Track-By-Track Album Review: Milk &amp;amp; Sugar - 20 Years Of Milk &amp;amp; Sugar</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./talks-ideas-worth-spreading-series-of-lectures.html>___ Talks (Ideas Worth Spreading series of lectures)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./akili-interactive-announces-board-nominees-ahead-of-spac-and-more-digital-health-hires.html>Akili Interactive announces board nominees ahead of SPAC and more digital health hires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./garly-sojo-s-obituary-venezuelan-basketball-player-garly-sojo-passed-away-at-the-age-of-24.html>Garly Sojos obituary: Venezuelan basketball player Garly Sojo passed away at the age of 24</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenzy-wolfe-is-she-still-dylan-larkin-s-girlfriend.html>Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nickname-of-the-16th-us-president.html>Nickname of the 16th US president</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
