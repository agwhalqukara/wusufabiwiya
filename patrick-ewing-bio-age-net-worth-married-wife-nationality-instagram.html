Patrick Ewing rose to the spotlight for his outstanding performances as a basketball player.</h3><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Childhood>Early Life and Childhood</span></h2><p>Patrick Aloysius Ewing stepped into this world on <strong>August 5, 1962,</strong> in Kingston, Jamaica. His zodiac sign is Leo and he is <strong>59 years old</strong>. he was born into a Jamaican family. Moreover, he was born to his father Carl Ewing and his mother Dorothy Ewing. His father was a mechanic and his mother was a homemaker who stayed at home to raise the family’s seven children.</p><p>His parents emigrated to the United States when he was seven years old. However, the family faced so much financial hardship that Ewing remained on the island with his siblings for four years, until his parents acquired enough money to move each of the children to the United States. At the age of 11, Ewing immigrated to America and settled in a five-room cottage in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with the rest of his family.</p><p>He was expelled from cricket and soccer but never played basketball before. However, he learned to play basketball with the aid of several neighborhood kids playing a pick-up game. The young man, who was already six feet six inches tall at the age of twelve, took to the game with ease. Ewing worked hard as a high school student at Cambridge’s Rindge and Latin School, determined to flourish. On the court, Ewing led his team to three state titles and tried out for the 1980 Olympic squad. Despite not making the squad, the experience was a blessing for the young player.</p><p>Moreover, Ewing was the first high school student to participate in the Olympic basketball tryouts. Moreover, Petrick also enrolled in the MIT-Wellesley Upward Bound Program, which is a college-preparation program for economically disadvantaged high school students. Ewing was accepted to Georgetown University in Washington, DC as a result of his hard work.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>As a Georgetown athlete, Ewing soon rose to the position of team leader. The Georgetown Hoyas reached the NCAA tournament championship game three of the four years Ewing was on the squad, thanks to his leadership. In 1984, the Hoyas won the NCAA championship.</p><p>In the same championship, Ewing won the tournament’s Outstanding Star, defeating veteran player Hakeem Olajuwon for the honor. That same year, Ewing tried out for the United States Olympic basketball squad once more. This time, he was recognized as a member of the squad that won the gold medal that year.</p><p>Ewing kept his commitment to his mother to graduate high school. Until his graduation in 1985, he turned down several lucrative endorsements and professional ball opportunities. Ewing was in great demand by the National Basketball Association that year. Ewing was chosen first overall by the New York Knicks after winning the Draft Lottery.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-167773 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Patrick-Ewing-as-a-coachsource-Instagram.jpg alt="Patrick Ewing" width=650 height=512 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-167773 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Patrick Ewing as a coach(source: Instagram)</p><h4>New York Knicks</h4><p>Despite suffering many ailments during his first season, Ewing managed to average 20 points, nine rebounds, and two blocks per game.
