Michael Terrance McKenzie (born April 26, 1976) is a former American football cornerback in the National Football League. He was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the third round of the 1999 NFL Draft. He also played for the New Orleans Saints. He played college football at Memphis.</p><p>McKenzie was placed on injured reserve for the final game of 2007 after tearing his ACL the week before. McKenzie came back from the injury to start in 6 games in 2008, but once again suffered a major knee injury in early November. He was again placed on injured reserve, this time with a fractured right kneecap.</p><p>Ultimately, McKenzie appeared in five games (two starts) for the Saints in 2009, recording 11 tackles and an interception. When the team’s starting cornerbacks had recovered from their injuries, McKenzie was waived prior to the regular season finale on January 2, 2010, allowing the team to promote quarterback Chase Daniel to the active roster. Although McKenzie was no longer on the roster when the Saints won Super Bowl XLIV, the team awarded him with a Super Bowl ring in recognition of his contributions.</p><p align=justify>McKenzie currently owns a home in New Orleans, Louisiana and splits his offseason residence between Miami, Florida and Memphis, Tennessee. McKenzie established a non-profit organization, the 34 Ways Foundation to help underprivileged youth. The Foundation serves various regions including Miami, Florida, New Orleans, Louisiana, Memphis, Tennessee, and Los Angeles, California. He was awarded the 2007 New Orleans Saints Man of the Year Award for this work.
